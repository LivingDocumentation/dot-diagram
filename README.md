# dot-diagram
A simple Java wrapper on top of Graphviz dot tool. It offers two basic layers of functionalities.

# API on top of the Dot Syntax

This project provides a convenient API (DotGraph) to create graphs, including sub-graphs (clusters), that are then rendered into .dot syntax text.

# Convenience on top of the Graphviz tool
This project also offers for convenience a DotWriter that launches Graphviz to render the dot file into an image file. This requires Graphviz to be installed on the machine, along with read/write access to the disk for temporary .dot files.
